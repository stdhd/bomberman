The team worked on setting up the first training case (coins only). Steps taken: Creating a new main function and modifying the environment file.

Jakob wrote a document outlining the general situation and outlook so far. The team began outlining first tasks to complete and began work on state capturing system to generate training data. Drafted a state vector representation format for use in training. 

Agenda: 

- Create state capturing system for episodes
- Create system to generate training data from saved games
- Further research reinforcement learning to understand how to apply it properly

The team has completed the first step in saving game states to disk. -> Some multiprocessing errors encountered. 

Now working on completing observation function from saved game states. Discussion: Should we use reinforcement learning or regression to estimate game state values directly (e.g. kernel ridge regression)?

Agenda: 

- Add new hand-selected features for observation function
- Working on system to generate training data from saved games and observation function
- Considered how to identify rotated or mirrored states in training data (speed up training)
