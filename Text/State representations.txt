In order to test the efficacy of various machine learning approaches for our task, it is convenient to have a database of played games to use as a basis for training. 


The alternative to this approach - playing games and training models "live", without saving them to the disk somehow - has the disadvantage that all games played are "lost" and cannot be reused, and that one cannot compare the performance of different models to each other on the same data. 


For this reason, the team chose to develop a vectorized representation of the game state which contains all information for a single game step.
